# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Migration to Google ADK for Agentic AI Application

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements and steps to migrate the existing Code Analysis Agent to utilize the Google ADK (Agent Development Kit) for building an agentic AI application. The migration aims to retain the current functionality while adopting the agentic methodology provided by Google ADK.

## Goals
1. **Agentic AI Transition**: Leverage Google ADK to transform the application into an agentic AI system.
2. **Feature Parity**: Ensure all existing features and functionalities are preserved.
3. **Scalability**: Enhance the system's scalability and maintainability using Google ADK.
4. **Integration**: Seamlessly integrate Google ADK while maintaining compatibility with existing workflows.

## Current Functionality
The current system provides the following features:
- Code analysis based on predefined rules.
- JSON reports and annotated code files with recommendations.
- Multi-rule analysis using LangChain and Google Gemini APIs.

## Migration Requirements
### Functional Requirements
1. **Agentic Framework**:
   - Replace LangChain with Google ADK for agent orchestration.
   - Implement agents for each rule using Google ADK's agentic methodology.

2. **Rule Analysis**:
   - Migrate existing rule analysis logic to Google ADK.
   - Ensure each rule is handled by an independent agent.

3. **Output Formats**:
   - Retain JSON reports and annotated code outputs.
   - Ensure outputs are consistent with the current system.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement robust error handling using Google ADK's capabilities.

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**:
   - Ensure the migrated system performs at least as efficiently as the current implementation.

2. **Scalability**:
   - Design the system to support additional rules and agents in the future.

3. **Maintainability**:
   - Use Google ADK's best practices to ensure the codebase is maintainable.

## Migration Steps
1. **Setup Google ADK**:
   - Install and configure Google ADK in the project.
   - Update dependencies in `requirements.txt`.

2. **Refactor Agents**:
   - Rewrite existing agents using Google ADK.
   - Ensure each agent adheres to the agentic methodology.

3. **Update Orchestration**:
   - Replace LangChain workflows with Google ADK's orchestration mechanisms.

4. **Testing**:
   - Validate the migrated system against existing test cases.
   - Add new test cases to cover Google ADK-specific functionality.

5. **Documentation**:
   - Update documentation to reflect the migration to Google ADK.

## Deliverables
1. Migrated codebase using Google ADK.
2. Updated `requirements.txt` with Google ADK dependencies.
3. Comprehensive test suite covering all functionalities.
4. Updated documentation and user guides.

## Timeline
The migration is expected to take approximately 4 weeks, with the following milestones:
- Week 1: Setup and initial migration.
- Week 2: Refactor agents and update orchestration.
- Week 3: Testing and validation.
- Week 4: Documentation and final review.
