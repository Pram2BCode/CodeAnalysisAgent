# Fine-tuning steps for improving the agent's comment generation and error-fixing capabilities.

## Objective
The goal is to refine the agent's ability to generate comments that are concise, clear, and actionable. Additionally, the agent should suggest fixes for errors in the format `////// {suggested changes from agent}/////`.

## Steps for Fine-Tuning

### 1. Data Collection
- Collect examples of well-written comments and error-fixing suggestions from the current project and other sources.
- Ensure the examples include both the problem description and the suggested fix.

### 2. Data Preparation
- Organize the collected examples into a structured format (e.g., JSON or CSV).
- Include fields for:
  - Problem description
  - Suggested fix
  - Context (e.g., code snippet or file name)

### 3. Model Training
- Use a pre-trained language model as the base.
- Fine-tune the model using the prepared dataset.
- Set up a validation set to evaluate the model's performance during training.

### 4. Testing and Evaluation
- Test the fine-tuned model on unseen examples from the project.
- Evaluate the clarity and accuracy of the generated comments and suggestions.

### 5. Integration
- Integrate the fine-tuned model into the project.
- Update the `xcode_annotated.py` file to include the new comment format and suggestions.

### 6. Deployment
- Deploy the updated project to the production environment.
- Monitor the performance and gather feedback for further improvements.

## Example Dataset Entry
```json
{
  "problem_description": "Line length exceeds 80-120 characters.",
  "suggested_fix": "Break the line into multiple lines or shorten variable names.",
  "context": "DEFAULT_ENROLLMENT_YEAR = 2024"
}
```

## Example Comment Format
```python
# Problem: Line length exceeds 80-120 characters.
# Fix: Break the line into multiple lines or shorten variable names.
```

## Example Code with Suggestions
```python
DEFAULT_ENROLLMENT_YEAR = 2024
# Problem: Line length exceeds 80-120 characters.
# Fix: ////// Break the line into multiple lines or shorten variable names. /////
```
